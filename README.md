himmel Jederzeit Plugin f√ºr die Coolstream


This Plugin will provide as many features as possible from the Sky Anytime Concept for Neutrino HD Receiver.

I want to enable the automated records for all the movies and series from sky, which are usually provided by the official Sky Receiver.

First of all the automation will only generate files which can be further process by the pr-auto-timer plugin.

Features neccessary :

done      - parse sky list and create files in readable format
done      - create the timing for records as good as possible ( maybe configurable only during some hours )
done      - store the records in an defined structure
done      - make it configurable which kind of records shall be startet ( like Kids, Thriller, Docu ... )
almost      - taking care that a record is only done once
      
Features nice to have:

      - download Pictures from e.g. IMDB 
      - send information to the user which records have been initiated and which could'nt
      - configurable autodelete for records
      
Features I would really like:

      - make a webpart to see the records and apply filters
      - configurable move to another partition instead of delete
      
thats all Folks ( as for now ;) )
